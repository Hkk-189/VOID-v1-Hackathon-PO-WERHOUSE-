## 🚀 How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /home/hkk/test12/hackathon:VOID:v1
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

### Demo Mode Testing
1. Launch app
2. Select role (Sender/Receiver)
3. Fill registration form
4. Click "Send OTP" - OTP appears in snackbar for 5 seconds
5. Enter the 6-digit OTP
6. Complete registration
7. Navigate to dashboard

## 🎯 Key Features Working

### ✅ Fully Functional
- Registration with OTP
- Login (offline/online)
- Role selection
- Theme switching
- Language toggle (EN/HI)
- TTS confirmations
- Encrypted storage
- Password hashing
- Device ID enforcement

### ⚠️ Ready but Need Hardware
- Bluetooth scanning (requires physical device)
- NFC operations (requires NFC-enabled device)
- Biometric authentication (requires device with biometrics)

### 📝 Basic Structure (Need Enhancement)
- Send screen (needs channel integration)
- Receive screen (needs listener integration)
- History screen (needs real data display)
- Settings screen (needs full controls)
- Dashboard (needs enhanced UI)

## 🔧 Configuration Needed for Production

### 1. Firebase Setup
```bash
# Create Firebase project
# Download google-services.json → android/app/
# Download GoogleService-Info.plist → ios/Runner/
# Enable Authentication and Firestore
```

### 2. Android Permissions
Add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NFC"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"/>
```

### 3. iOS Permissions
Add to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need Bluetooth for payment transfers</string>
<key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need NFC for payment transfers</string>
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need Face ID for authentication</string>
```
